          <p>
            Despite their recent popularity, next to no audiobooks utilise
            binaural audio (3D audio in essence), leaving the story no more
            immersive than that of a regular book. Therefore this project
            implemented a binaural audiobook creation tool. This tool allows
            creators to make binaural audio with the use of the visual spatial
            circles. It is as simple as pressing record and then putting the red
            cirle where you want the audio to come from.

          <h3>Technical details</h3>
          <p>
            It was found that in natural spatial hearing, interaural and dynamic
            cues are used for directional location. To implement the interaural
            cues, sound has to be either recorded using a dummy head or by
            modifying the audio using the impulse responses from such a head.
            Pre-made HRIR's (Head Related Impulse Responses) made it possible to
            synthesise binaural audio. A gyroscope made it possible to move the
            binaural audio around the listeners head, to simulate the dynamic
            cue. This project was a 5th semester university project from AAU
            which was praised by the examiner and censor.
