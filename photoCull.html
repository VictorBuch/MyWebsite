            This is my bachelor project about culling photos automatically with
            the help of neaural networks. It's a project made in colaboration
            with the
            <a href="https://www.captureone.com/en" target="blank"
              >Capture One</a
            >
            company who make photo editing software. The goal of the project was
            to make the photo culling process faster and easier for the
            professional photographers who spent most of their time sorting
            through the images they take at events. Therefore a website with the
            UI and UX was developed to test the user experience of what would be
            the final product. A neural network was also developed to
            automatically pick out the best images from a given set to be used
            on the website.

          <h3>Technical details</h3>
          <p>
            I was in charge of making the website for this project and for this
            React, HTML, styled components (SCSS) and JavaScript was used. The
            main functionallity that we found to be needed was to have the
            images that looked similar, clustered together, so that was done by
            taking the EXIF metadata from the images more specifically the
            created time in milliseconds. Then there was a lot of keeping track
            of global state and sending the state to wherever it was needed,
            such as keeping track of which image is highlighted and what cluster
            to display when in the fullscreen view. To try this for yourself go
            to
