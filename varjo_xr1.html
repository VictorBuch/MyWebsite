            It has been shown that the immersion in Augmented Reality can be
            improved by utilizing image effects to bridge the visual appearance
            of the real and virtual worlds. In this project, a state of the art
            XR-1 headset from
            <a

            was used to test, if the same applies to Mixed Reality. By sylizing
            what the user sees a more immersive mixed- and virtual reality was
            achieved. These styles applied range from barely noticable to
            completly world altering. What is seen in the image is the
            <em>cartoon</em> style which was in the middle on a scale of
            abstraction.

          <h3>Technical details</h3>
          <p>
            By using shaders and standard image processing techniques, I
            modified both the camera video feed and the generated 3D graphics to
            produce three distinct image effects: Watercolor, Cartoon, and
            Sketch. These were evaluated in an immersive MR application, which
            allowed participants to freely transition between real and virtual
            worlds. The results from testing were promising and indicate that a
            proper use of stylization can bridge the two realities and as such
            improve the user experience. This project was a 5th semester
            university project from AAU that was praised by the examiner and
            censor.
